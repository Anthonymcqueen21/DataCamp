'''
Loop over Numpy array
100xp
If you're dealing with a 1D Numpy array, looping over all elements can be as simple as:

for x in my_array :
    ...
If you're dealing with a 2D Numpy array, it's more complicated. A 2D array is built up of
multiple 1D arrays. To explicitly iterate over all separate elements of a multi-dimensional
array, you'll need this syntax:

for x in np.nditer(my_array) :
    ...
Two Numpy arrays that you might recognize from the intro course are available in your Python
session: np_height, a Numpy array containing the heights of Major League Baseball players,
and np_baseball, a 2D Numpy array that contains both the heights (first column) and weights
(second column) of those players.

Instructions
-Import the numpy package under the local alias np.
-Write a for loop that iterates over all elements in np_height and prints out "x inches"
for each element, where x is the value in the array.
-Write a for loop that visits every element of the np_baseball array and prints it out.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# For loop over np_height
for x in np_height:
    print(str(x) + " inches")

# For loop over np_baseball
for x in np.nditer(np_baseball):
    print(x)
