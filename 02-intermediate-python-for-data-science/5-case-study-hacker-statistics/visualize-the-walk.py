'''
Visualize the walk
100xp
Let's visualize this random walk! Remember how you could use matplotlib to build a line plot?

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
The first list you pass is mapped onto the x axis and the second list is mapped onto the y axis.

If you pass only one argument, Python will know what to do and will use the index of the
list to map onto the x axis, and the values in the list onto the y axis.

Instructions
Add some lines of code after the for loop:

-Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
-Use plt.plot() to plot random_walk.
-Finish off with plt.show() to actually display the plot.

# Initialization
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot random_walk
plt.plot(random_walk)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
