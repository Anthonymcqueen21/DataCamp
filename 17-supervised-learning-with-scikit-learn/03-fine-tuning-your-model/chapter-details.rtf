Having trained your model, your next task is to evaluate its performance. What metrics can you use to gauge how good your model is? So far, you have used accuracy for classification and R-squared for regression. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn that will allow you to assess your model's performance in a more nuanced manner. You will then learn to optimize both your classification as well as regression models using hyperparameter tuning.}
