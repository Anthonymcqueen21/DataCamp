DataFrame data types

Pandas is aware of the data types in the columns of your DataFrame. It is also aware of null and NaN ('Not-a-Number') types which often indicate missing data. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in the world population data which contains some NaN values, a value often used as a place-holder for missing or otherwise invalid data entries. Your job is to use df.info() to determine information about the total count of non-null entries and infer the total count of 'null' entries, which likely indicates missing data. Select the best description of this data set from the following:
