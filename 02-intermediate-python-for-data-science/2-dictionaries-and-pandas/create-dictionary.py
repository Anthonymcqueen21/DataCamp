The countries and capitals lists are again available in the script.
It's your job to convert this data to a dictionary where the country names are
the keys and the capitals are the corresponding values. As a refresher, here is a
recipe for creating a dictionary:

my_dict = {
   "key1":"value1",
   "key2":"value2",
}

In this recipe, both the keys and the values are strings.
This will also be the case for this exercise.

Instructions
-With the strings in countries and capitals, create a dictionary called europe with
4 key:value pairs. Beware of capitalization! Make sure you use lowercase characters everywhere.
-Print out europe to see if the result is what you expected.
