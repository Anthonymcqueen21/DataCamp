Build a histogram (3): compare
100xp
In the video, you saw population pyramids for the present day and for the future.
Because we were using a histogram, it was very easy to make a comparison.

Let's do a similar comparison. life_exp contains life expectancy data for different
countries in 2007. You also have access to a second list now, life_exp1950, containing
similar data for 1950. Can you make a histogram for both datasets?

You'll again be making two plots. The plt.show() and plt.clf() commands to render
everything nicely are already included. Also matplotlib.pyplot is imported for you, as plt.

Instructions
-Build a histogram of life_exp with 15 bins.
-Build a histogram of life_exp1950, also with 15 bins. Is there a big difference with the histogram for the 2007 data?
'''
# Histogram of life_exp, 15 bins
plt.hist(life_exp, bins=15)

# Show and clear plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Histogram of life_exp1950, 15 bins
plt.hist(life_exp1950, bins=15)

# Show and clear plot again
plt.show()
plt.clf()
