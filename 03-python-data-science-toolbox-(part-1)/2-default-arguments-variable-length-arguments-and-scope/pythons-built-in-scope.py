Python's built-in scope
50xp

Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really just a
built-in module called builtins. However, to query builtins, you'll need to import
builtins 'because the name builtins is not itself built in...No, Iâ€™m serious!'
(Learning Python, 5th edition, Mark Lutz). After executing import builtins in the
IPython Shell, execute dir(builtins) to print a list of all the names in the module
builtins. Have a look and you'll see a bunch of names that you'll recognize! Which
of the following names is NOT in the module builtins?
