List Methods
100xp
Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats,
integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods.
In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: areas.

Instructions
-Use the index() method to get the index of the element in areas that is equal to 20.0.
Print out this index.
-Call count() on areas to find out how many times 14.5 appears in the list.
Again, simply print out this number.
'''
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20))

# Print out how often 14.5 appears in areas
print(areas.count(14.5))
