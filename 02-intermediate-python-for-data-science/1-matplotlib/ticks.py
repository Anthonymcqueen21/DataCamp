Ticks
100xp
The customizations you've coded up to now are available in the script,
in a more concise form.

In the video, Filip has demonstrated how you could control the y-ticks by
specifying two arguments:

plt.yticks([0,1,2], ["one","two","three"])
In this example, the ticks corresponding to the numbers 0, 1 and 2 will be
replaced by one, two and three, respectively.

Let's do a similar thing for the x-axis of your world development chart,
with the xticks() function. The tick values 1000, 10000 and 100000 should be
replaced by 1k, 10k and 100k. To this end, two lists have already been created
for you: tick_val and tick_lab.

Instructions
-Use tick_val and tick_lab as inputs to the xticks() function to make the the plot more readable.
-As usual, display the plot with plt.show() after you've added the customizations.

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log') 
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')

# Definition of tick_val and tick_lab
tick_val = [1000,10000,100000]
tick_lab = ['1k','10k','100k']

# Adapt the ticks on the x-axis
plt.xticks(tick_val, tick_lab)

# After customizing, display the plot
plt.show()
