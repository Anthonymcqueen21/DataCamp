pandas scatter plots

Pandas scatter plots are generated using the kind='scatter' keyword argument. Scatter plots require that the x and y columns be chosen by specifying the x and y parameters inside .plot(). Scatter plots also take an s keyword argument to provide the radius of each circle to plot in pixels.

In this exercise, you're going to plot fuel efficiency (miles-per-gallon) versus horse-power for 392 automobiles manufactured from 1970 to 1982 from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The size of each circle is provided as a NumPy array called sizes. This array contains the normalized 'weight' of each automobile in the dataset.

All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

INSTRUCTIONS

Generate a scatter plot with 'hp' on the x-axis and 'mpg' on the y-axis. Specify s=sizes.
Add a title to the plot.
Specify the x-axis and y-axis labels.
'''
# Generate a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='hp', y='mpg', s=sizes)

# Add the title
plt.title('Fuel efficiency vs Horse-power')

# Add the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Horse-power')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Fuel efficiency (mpg)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
