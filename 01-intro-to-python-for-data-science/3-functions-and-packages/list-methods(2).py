List Methods (2)
100xp
Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: areas.

Instructions
-Use append() twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: 24.5 and 15.45, respectively. 
Make sure to add them in this order.
-Print out areas
-Use the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements in areas.
-Print out areas once more.
