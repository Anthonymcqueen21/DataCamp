Scatter plot (2)
100xp
In the previous exercise, you saw that that the higher GDP usually corresponds to a higher
life expectancy. In other words, there is a positive correlation.

Do you think there's a relationship between population and life expectancy of a country?
The list life_exp from the previous exercise is already available. In addition, now also pop is available, listing the corresponding populations for the countries in 2007. The populations are in millions of people.

Instructions
-Start from scratch: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
-Build a scatter plot, where pop is mapped on the horizontal axis, and life_exp is mapped
on the vertical axis.
-Finish the script with plt.show() to actually display the plot. Do you see a correlation?
