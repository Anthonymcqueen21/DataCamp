In the previous chapter, you made use of image and political datasets to predict binary as well as multiclass outcomes. But what if your problem requires a continuous outcome? Regression, which is the focus of this chapter, is best suited to solving such problems. You will learn about fundamental concepts in regression and apply them to predict the life expectancy in a given country using Gapminder data.}
