Recapping built-in functions
50xp
In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in functions
print() and str(). Here, you will use both functions and examine their return values.
A variable x has been preloaded for this exercise. Run the code below in the console.
Pay close attention to the results to answer the question that follows.

Assign str(x) to a variable y1: y1 = str(x)
Assign print(x) to a variable y2: y2 = print(x)
Check the types of the variables x, y1, and y2.

What are the types of x, y1, and y2?

Possible Answers
They are all str types.
x is a float, y1 is an float, and y2 is a str.
x is a float, y1 is a str, and y2 is a NoneType.
They are all NoneType types.
