Select the valid list
50xp
A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list! Python is getting funkier by the minute, but fear not, just remember the list syntax:

my_list = [el1, el2, el3]
Can you tell which ones of the following lines of Python code are valid ways to build a list?

A. [1, 3, 4, 2] B. [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 7]] C. [1 + 2, "a" * 5, 3]
