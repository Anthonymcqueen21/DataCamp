Computing log loss with NumPy

To see how the log loss metric handles the trade-off between accuracy and confidence, we will use some sample data generated with NumPy and compute the log loss using the provided function compute_log_loss(), which Peter showed you in the video.

5 one-dimensional numeric arrays simulating different types of predictions have been pre-loaded: actual_labels, correct_confident, correct_not_confident, wrong_not_confident, and wrong_confident.

Your job is to compute the log loss for each sample set provided using the compute_log_loss(predicted_values, actual_values). It takes the predicted values as the first argument and the actual values as the second argument.

Using the compute_log_loss() function, compute the log loss for the following predicted values (in each case, the actual values are contained in actual_labels):
correct_confident.
correct_not_confident.
wrong_not_confident.
wrong_confident.
actual_labels.

# Compute and print log loss for 1st case
correct_confident = compute_log_loss(correct_confident, actual_labels)
print("Log loss, correct and confident: {}".format(correct_confident)) 

# Compute log loss for 2nd case
correct_not_confident = compute_log_loss(correct_not_confident, actual_labels)
print("Log loss, correct and not confident: {}".format(correct_not_confident)) 

# Compute and print log loss for 3rd case
wrong_not_confident = compute_log_loss(wrong_not_confident, actual_labels)
print("Log loss, wrong and not confident: {}".format(wrong_not_confident)) 

# Compute and print log loss for 4th case
wrong_confident = compute_log_loss(wrong_confident, actual_labels)
print("Log loss, wrong and confident: {}".format(wrong_confident)) 

# Compute and print log loss for actual labels
actual_labels = compute_log_loss(actual_labels, actual_labels)
print("Log loss, actual labels: {}".format(actual_labels))
