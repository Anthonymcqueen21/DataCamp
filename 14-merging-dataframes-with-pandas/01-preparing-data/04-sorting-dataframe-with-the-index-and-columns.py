Sorting DataFrame with the Index & columns

It is often useful to rearrange the sequence of the rows of a DataFrame by sorting. You don't have to implement these yourself; the principal methods for doing this are .sort_index() and .sort_values().

In this exercise, you'll use these methods with a DataFrame of temperature values indexed by month names. You'll sort the rows alphabetically using the Index and numerically using a column. Notice, for this data, the original ordering is probably most useful and intuitive: the purpose here is for you to understand what the sorting methods do.

Read 'monthly_max_temp.csv' into a DataFrame called weather1 with 'Month' as the index.
Sort the index of weather1 in alphabetical order using the .sort_index() method and store the result in weather2.
Sort the index of weather1 in reverse alphabetical order by specifying the additional keyword argument ascending=False inside .sort_index().
Use the .sort_values() method to sort weather1 in increasing numerical order according to the values of the column 'Max TemperatureF'.
