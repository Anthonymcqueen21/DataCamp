Reindexing using another DataFrame Index

Another common technique is to reindex a DataFrame using the Index of another DataFrame. The DataFrame .reindex() method can accept the Index of a DataFrame or Series as input. You can access the Index of a DataFrame with its .index attribute.

The Baby Names Dataset from data.gov summarizes counts of names (with genders) from births registered in the US since 1881. In this exercise, you will start with two baby-names DataFrames names_1981 and names_1881 loaded for you.

The DataFrames names_1981 and names_1881 both have a MultiIndex with levels name and gender giving unique labels to counts in each row. If you're interested in seeing how the MultiIndexes were set up, names_1981 and names_1881 were read in using the following commands:

names_1981 = pd.read_csv('names1981.csv', header=None, names=['name','gender','count'], index_col=(0,1))
names_1881 = pd.read_csv('names1881.csv', header=None, names=['name','gender','count'], index_col=(0,1))
As you can see by looking at their shapes, which have been printed in the IPython Shell, the DataFrame corresponding to 1981 births is much larger, reflecting the greater diversity of names in 1981 as compared to 1881.

Your job here is to use the DataFrame .reindex() and .dropna() methods to make a DataFrame common_names counting names from 1881 that were still popular in 1981.

INSTRUCTIONS
100XP
Create a new DataFrame common_names by reindexing names_1981 using the Index of the DataFrame names_1881 of older names.
Print the shape of the new common_names DataFrame. This has been done for you. It should be the same as that of names_1881.
Drop the rows of common_names that have null counts using the .dropna() method. These rows correspond to names that fell out of fashion between 1881 & 1981.
Print the shape of the reassigned common_names DataFrame. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!
