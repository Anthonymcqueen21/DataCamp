Strings in Python
50xp
In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype, strings. Recall that these
represent textual data. To assign the string 'DataCamp' to a variable company, you execute:

company = 'DataCamp'

You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings. Unlike with numeric types
such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates
multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on
strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:

object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
object2 = 1 * 3
object3 = "1" * 3
What are the values in object1, object2, and object3, respectively?

Possible Answers
object1 contains "data + analysis + visualization", object2 contains "1*3", object3 contains 13.
object1 contains "data+analysis+visualization", object2 contains 3, object3 contains "13".
object1 contains "dataanalysisvisualization", object2 contains 3, object3 contains "111".
