'''
Roll the dice
100xp
In the previous exercise, you used rand(), that generates a random float between 0 and 1.

As Filip explained in the video you can just as well use randint(), also a function of the
random package, to generate integers randomly. The following call generates the integer
4, 5, 6 or 7 randomly. 8 is not included.

import numpy as np
np.random.randint(4, 8)

Numpy has already been imported as np and a seed has been set. Can you roll some dice?

Instructions
-Use randint() with the appropriate arguments to randomly generate the integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
This simulates a dice. Print it out.
-Repeat the outcome to see if the second throw is different. Again, print out the result.

# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Use randint() to simulate a dice
print(np.random.randint(1, 7))

# Use randint() again
print(np.random.randint(1, 7))
