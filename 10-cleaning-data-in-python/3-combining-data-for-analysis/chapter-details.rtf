The ability to transform and combine your data is a crucial skill in data science, because your data may not always come in one monolithic file or table for you to load. A large dataset may be broken into separate datasets to facilitate easier storage and sharing. Or if you are dealing with time series data, for example, you may have a new dataset for each day. No matter the reason, it is important to be able to combine datasets so you can either clean a single dataset, or clean each dataset separately and then combine them later so you can run your analysis on a single dataset. In this chapter, you'll learn all about combining data.}
