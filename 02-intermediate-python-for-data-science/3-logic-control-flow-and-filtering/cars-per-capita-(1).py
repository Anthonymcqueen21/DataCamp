'''
Cars per capita (1)
100xp
Let's stick to the cars data some more. This time you want to find out which countries have a
high cars per capita figure. In other words, in which countries do many people have a car,
or maybe multiple cars.

Similar to the previous example, you'll want to build up a boolean Series, that you can then
use to subset the cars DataFrame to select certain observations. If you want to do this in a
one-liner, that's perfectly fine!

Instructions
-Select the cars_per_cap column from cars as a Pandas Series and store it as cpc.
-Use cpc in combination with a comparison operator and 500. You want to end up with a boolean
Series that's True if the corresponding country has a cars_per_cap of more than 500 and False 
otherwise. Store this boolean Series as many_cars.
-Use many_cars to subset cars, similar to what you did before. Store the result as car_maniac.
-Print out car_maniac to see if you got it right.
'''
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
many_cars = cpc > 500
car_maniac = cars[many_cars]


# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)
