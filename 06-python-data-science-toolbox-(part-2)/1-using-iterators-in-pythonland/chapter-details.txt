Here, you'll learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with before when writing for loops! You'll learn about some very useful functions that will allow you to effectively work with iterators and finish the chapter with a use case that is pertinent to the world of Data Science - dealing with large amounts of data - in this case, data from Twitter that you will load in chunks using iterators!
