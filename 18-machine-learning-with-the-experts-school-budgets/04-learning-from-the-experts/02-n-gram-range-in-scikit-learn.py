'''
N-gram range in scikit-learn

In this exercise you'll insert a CountVectorizer instance into your pipeline for the main dataset, and compute multiple n-gram features to be used in the model.

In order to look for ngram relationships at multiple scales, you will use the ngram_range parameter as Peter discussed in the video.

Special functions: You'll notice a couple of new steps provided in the pipeline in this and many of the remaining exercises. Specifically, the dim_red step following the vectorizer step , and the scale step preceeding the clf (classification) step.

These have been added in order to account for the fact that you're using a reduced-size sample of the full dataset in this course. To make sure the models perform as the expert competition winner intended, we have to apply a dimensionality reduction technique, which is what the dim_red step does, and we have to scale the features to lie between -1 and 1, which is what the scale step does.

The dim_red step uses a scikit-learn function called SelectKBest(), applying something called the chi-squared test to select the K "best" features. The scale step uses a scikit-learn function called MaxAbsScaler() in order to squash the relevant features into the interval -1 to 1.

You won't need to do anything extra with these functions here, just complete the vectorizing pipeline steps below. However, notice how easy it was to add more processing steps to our pipeline!
