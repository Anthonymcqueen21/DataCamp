Exploratory analysis

Whenever you obtain a new dataset, your first task should always be to do some exploratory analysis to get a better understanding of the data and diagnose it for any potential issues.

The Gapminder data for the 19th century has been loaded into a DataFrame called g1800s. In the IPython Shell, use pandas methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe(), and DataFrame attributes like .columns and .shape to explore it.

Use the information that you acquire from your exploratory analysis to choose the true statement from the options provided below.
