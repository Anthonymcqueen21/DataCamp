Have another look at the for loop that Filip showed in the video:

fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
for height in fam : 
    print(height)
As usual, you simply have to indent the code with 4 spaces to tell Python
which code should be executed in the for loop.

The areas variable, containing the area of different rooms in your house,
is already defined.

Instructions
Write a for loop that iterates over all elements of the areas list and prints
out every element separately.
'''
# areas list
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Code the for loop
for a in areas:
    print(a)
