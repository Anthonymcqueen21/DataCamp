'''
Implement clumsiness
100xp
With this neatly written code of yours, changing the number of times the random walk
should be simulated is super-easy. You simply update the range() function in the
top-level for loop.

There's still something we forgot! You're a bit clumsy and you have a 0.1% chance of
falling down. That calls for another random number generation. Basically, you can
generate a random float between 0 and 1. If this value is less than or equal to 0.001,
you should reset step to 0.

Instructions
-Change the range() function so that the simulation is performed 250 times.
-Finish the if condition so that step is set to 0 if a random float is less or
equal to 0.001. Use np.random.rand().
