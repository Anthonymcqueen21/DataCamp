NMF features of the Wikipedia articles

Now you will explore the NMF features you created in the previous exercise. A solution to the previous exercise has been pre-loaded, so the array nmf_features is available. Also available is a list titles giving the title of each Wikipedia article.

When investigating the features, notice that for both actors, the NMF feature 3 has by far the highest value. This means that both articles are reconstructed using mainly the 3rd NMF component. In the next video, you'll see why: NMF components represent topics (for instance, acting!).

INSTRUCTIONS

Import pandas as pd.
Create a DataFrame df from nmf_features using pd.DataFrame(). Set the index to titles using index=titles.
Use the .loc[] accessor of df to select the row with title 'Anne Hathaway', and print the result. These are the NMF features for the article about the actress Anne Hathaway.
Repeat the last step for 'Denzel Washington' (another actor).
