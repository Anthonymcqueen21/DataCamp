Selective import
100xp
General imports, like import math, make all functionality from the math package available to you.
However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import
more selective:

from math import pi
Let's say the Moon's orbit around planet Earth is a perfect circle, with a radius r (in km) that
is defined in the script.

Instructions
-Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the radians function.
-Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result
to dist. You can calculate this as r * phi, where r is the radius and phi is the angle in radians.
To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the radians() function, which you just
imported.
-Print out dist.
'''
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
phi = radians(12)
dist = r * phi

# Print out dist
print(dist)
