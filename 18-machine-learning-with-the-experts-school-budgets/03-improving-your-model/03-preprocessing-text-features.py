'''
Preprocessing text features

Here, you'll perform a similar preprocessing pipeline step, only this time you'll use the text column from the sample data.

To preprocess the text, you'll turn to CountVectorizer() to generate a bag-of-words representation of the data, as in Chapter 2. Using the default arguments, add a (step, transform) tuple to the steps list in your pipeline.

Make sure you select only the text column for splitting your training and test sets.

As usual, your sample_df is ready and waiting in the workspace.

Import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
Create training and test sets by selecting the correct subset of sample_df: 'text'.
Add the 'CountVectorizer' step (with the name 'vec') to the correct position in the pipeline.
Fit the pipeline to the training data and compute its accuracy.

# Instantiate Pipeline object: pl
pl = Pipeline([
        ('vec', CountVectorizer()),
        ('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression()))
    ])

# Fit to the training data
pl.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compute and print accuracy
accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)
print("\nAccuracy on sample data - just text data: ", accuracy)
