'''
Hierarchical clustering of the grain data

In the video, you learned that the SciPy linkage() function performs hierarchical clustering on an array of samples. Use the linkage() function to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the grain samples, and use dendrogram() to visualize the result. A sample of the grain measurements is provided in the array samples, while the variety of each grain sample is given by the list varieties.

Import:
linkage and dendrogram from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='complete' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
Plot a dendrogram using the dendrogram() function on mergings. Specify the keyword arguments labels=varieties, leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6.

# Perform the necessary imports
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples, method='complete')

# Plot the dendrogram, using varieties as labels
dendrogram(mergings,
           labels=varieties,
           leaf_rotation=90,
           leaf_font_size=6,
)
