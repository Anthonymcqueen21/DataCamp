Scatter Plot (1)
100xp
When you have a time scale along the horizontal axis, the line plot is your friend.
But in many other cases, when you're trying to assess if there's a correlation between
two variables, for example, the scatter plot is the better choice. Below is an example
of how to build a scatter plot.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()
Let's continue with the gdp_cap versus life_exp plot, the GDP and life expectancy data
for different countries in 2007. Maybe a scatter plot will be a better alternative?

Again, the matploblib.pyplot package is available as plt.

Instructions
-Change the line plot that's coded in the script to a scatter plot.
-A correlation will become clear when you display the GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale.
Add the line plt.xscale('log').
-Finish off your script with plt.show() to display the plot.
'''

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Change the line plot below to a scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Put the x-axis on a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')

# Show plot
plt.show()
