Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use
it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: help().
In IPython specifically, you can also use ? before the function name.

To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

help(max)
?max
