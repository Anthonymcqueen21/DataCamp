Why we like flat files and the Zen of Python
50xp
In PythonLand, there are currently hundreds of Python Enhancement Proposals, commonly referred
to as PEPs. PEP8, for example, is a standard style guide for Python, written by our sensei
Guido van Rossum himself. It is the basis for how we here at DataCamp ask our instructors to
style their code. Another one of my favorites is PEP20, commonly called the Zen of Python.
Its abstract is as follows:

Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's
design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.
If you don't know what the acronym BDFL stands for, I suggest that you look here. You can
print the Zen of Python in your shell by typing import this into it! You're going to do this now and the 5th aphorism (line) will say something of particular interest.

The question you need to answer is: what is the 5th aphorism of the Zen of Python?

Possible Answers
-Flat is better than nested.
-Flat files are essential for data science.
-The world is representable as a flat file.
-Flatness is in the eye of the beholder.
