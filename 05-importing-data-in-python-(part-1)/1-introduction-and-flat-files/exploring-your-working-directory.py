Exploring your working directory
50xp

In order to import data into Python, you should first have an idea of what files
are in your working directory.

IPython, which is running on DataCamp's servers, has a bunch of cool commands,
including its magic commands. For example, starting a line with ! gives you
complete system shell access. This means that the IPython magic command ! ls will
display the contents of your current directory. Your task is to use the IPython
magic command ! ls to check out the contents of your current directory and answer
the following question: which of the following files is in your working directory?
