Line plot (3)
100xp
Now that you've built your first line plot, let's start working on the data that professor Hans Rosling used to build his beautiful bubble chart. It was collected in 2007. Two lists are available for you:

life_exp which contains the life expectancy for each country and
gdp_cap, which contains the GDP per capita (i.e. per person) for each country expressed in US Dollars.
GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It basically represents the size of the economy of a country. Divide this by the population and you get the GDP per capita.

matplotlib.pyplot is already imported as plt, so you can get started straight away.

Instructions
Print the last item from both the list gdp_cap, and the list life_exp; it is information about Zimbabwe.
Build a line chart, with gdp_cap on the x-axis, and life_exp on the y-axis. Does it make sense to plot this data on a line plot?
Don't forget to finish off with a plt.show() command, to actually display the plot.
'''
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Print the last item of gdp_cap and life_exp
print(gdp_cap[-1])
print(life_exp[-1])

# Make a line plot, gdp_cap on the x-axis, life_exp on the y-axis
plt.plot(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

# It does not make sense to show this data as a line chart.........
