It's time to take a closer look around in your house.

Two variables are defined in the sample code: room, a string that tells you which room of
the house we're looking at, and area, the area of that room.

Instructions
Examine the if statement that prints out "Looking around in the kitchen." if room equals "kit".
Write another if statement that prints out "big place!" if area is greater than 15.
'''
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area > 15:
    print("big place!")
