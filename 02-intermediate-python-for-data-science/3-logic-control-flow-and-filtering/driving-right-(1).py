Driving right (1)
100xp
Remember that cars dataset, containing the cars per 1000 people (cars_per_cap) and whether
people drive right (drives_right) for different countries (country)? The code that imports
this data in CSV format into Python as a DataFrame is available on the right.

In the video, you saw a step-by-step approach to filter observations from a DataFrame based
on boolean arrays. Let's start simple and try to find all observations in cars where drives_right
is True.

drives_right is a boolean column, so you'll have to extract it as a Series and then use this
boolean Series to select observations from cars.

Instructions
-Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series and store it as dr.
-Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in sel.
-Print sel, and assert that drives_right is True for all observations.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars['drives_right']

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)
