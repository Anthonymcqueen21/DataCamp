'''
Multiple types of processing: FeatureUnion

Now that you can separate text and numeric data in your pipeline, you're ready to perform separate steps on each by nesting pipelines and using FeatureUnion().

These tools will allow you to streamline all preprocessing steps for your model, even when multiple datatypes are involved. Here, for example, you don't want to impute our text data, and you don't want to create a bag-of-words with our numeric data. Instead, you want to deal with these separately and then join the results together using FeatureUnion().

In the end, you'll still have only two high-level steps in your pipeline: preprocessing and model instantiation. The difference is that the first preprocessing step actually consists of a pipeline for numeric data and a pipeline for text data. The results of those pipelines are joined using FeatureUnion().

In the process_and_join_features:
Add the steps ('selector', get_numeric_data) and ('imputer', Imputer()) to the 'numeric_features' preprocessing step.
Add the equivalent steps for the text_features preprocessing step. That is, use get_text_data and a CountVectorizer step with the name 'vectorizer.
Add the transform step process_and_join_features to 'union' in the main pipeline, pl.
