'''
Add column (1)
100xp
In the video, Filip showed you how to add the length of the country names of the
brics DataFrame in a new column:

for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    brics.loc[lab, "name_length"] = len(row["country"])

You can do similar things on the cars DataFrame.

Instructions
-Use a for loop to add a new column, named COUNTRY, that contains a uppercase
version of the country names in the "country" column. You can use the string
method upper() for this.
-To see if your code worked, print out cars. Don't indent this code, so that
it's not part of the for loop.
'''
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Code for loop that adds COUNTRY column
for lab, row in cars.iterrows():
    cars.loc[lab, 'COUNTRY'] = row['country'].upper()


# Print cars
print(cars)
