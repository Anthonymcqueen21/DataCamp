Centering and scaling your data

In the video, Hugo demonstrated how significantly the performance of a model can improve if the features are scaled. Note that this is not always the case: In the Congressional voting records dataset, for example, all of the features are binary. In such a situation, scaling will have minimal impact.

You will now explore scaling for yourself on a new dataset - White Wine Quality! Hugo used the Red Wine Quality dataset in the video. We have used the 'quality' feature of the wine to create a binary target variable: If 'quality' is less than 5, the target variable is 1, and otherwise, it is 0.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df, along with the feature and target variable arrays X and y. Explore it in the IPython Shell. Notice how some features seem to have different units of measurement. 'density', for instance, only takes values between 0 and 1, while 'total sulfur dioxide' has a maximum value of 289. As a result, it may be worth scaling the features here. Your job in this exercise is to scale the features and compute the mean and standard deviation of the unscaled features compared to the scaled features.

INSTRUCTIONS
100XP
Import scale from sklearn.preprocessing.
Scale the features X using scale().
Print the mean and standard deviation of the unscaled features X, and then the scaled features X_scaled. Use the numpy functions np.mean() and np.std() to compute the mean and standard deviations.
