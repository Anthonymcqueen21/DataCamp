You know that list comprehensions can be built over iterables. Given the following
objects below, which of these can we build list comprehensions over?

doctor = ['house', 'cuddy', 'chase', 'thirteen', 'wilson']

jean = '24601'

flash = ['jay garrick', 'barry allen', 'wally west', 'bart allen']

valjean = 24601
