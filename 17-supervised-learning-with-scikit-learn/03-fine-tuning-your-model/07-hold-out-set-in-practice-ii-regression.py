Hold-out set in practice II: Regression

Remember lasso and ridge regression from the previous chapter? Lasso used the L1
L
1
 penalty to regularize, while ridge used the L2
L
2
 penalty. There is another type of regularized regression known as the elastic net. In elastic net regularization, the penalty term is a linear combination of the L1
L
1
 and L2
L
2
 penalties:

a∗L1+b∗L2
a
∗
L
1
+
b
∗
L
2
In scikit-learn, this term is represented by the 'l1_ratio' parameter: An 'l1_ratio' of 1 corresponds to an L1
L
1
 penalty, and anything lower is a combination of L1
L
1
 and L2
L
2
.

In this exercise, you will GridSearchCV to tune the 'l1_ratio' of an elastic net model trained on the Gapminder data. As in the previous exercise, use a hold-out set to evaluate your model's performance.

INSTRUCTIONS
100XP
Import the following modules:
ElasticNet from sklearn.linear_model.
mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics.
GridSearchCV and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Create training and test sets, with 40% of the data used for the test set. Use a random state of 42.
Specify the hyperparameter grid for 'l1_ratio' using l1_space as the grid of values to search over.
Instantiate the ElasticNet regressor.
Use GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation to tune 'l1_ratio' on the training data X_train and y_train. This involves first instantiating the GridSearchCV object with the correct parameters and then fitting it to the training data.
Predict on the test set and compute the R2
R
2
 and mean squared error.
