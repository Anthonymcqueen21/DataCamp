Visualize all walks
100xp
all_walks is a list of lists: every sub-list represents a single random walk.
If you convert this list of lists to a Numpy array, you can start making interesting
plots! matplotlib.pyplot is already imported as plt.

The nested for loop is already coded for you - don't worry about it. For now,
focus on the code that comes after this for loop.

Instructions
-Use np.array() to convert all_walks to a Numpy array, np_aw.
-Try to use plt.plot() on np_aw. Also include plt.show(). Does it work out of the box?
-Transpose np_aw by calling np.transpose() on np_aw. Call the result np_aw_t.
Now every row in np_all_walks represents the position after 1 throw for the 10 random walks.
-Use plt.plot() to plot np_aw_t; also include a plt.show(). Does it look better this time?
