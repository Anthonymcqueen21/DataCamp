Getting the terminology down

Getting tripped up over terminology is a common cause of frustration in students. Unfortunately, you 
often will read and hear other data scientists using different terminology for bootstrap samples and 
replicates. This is even more reason why we need everything to be clear and consistent for this course.

with n repeated measurements, a bootstrap sample is an array of length n that was drawn from the original
data with replacement. What is a bootstrap replicate?
