In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists and lists of lists in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python Data Science toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory but instead generate on the fly.
