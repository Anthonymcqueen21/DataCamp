This chapter is all about finding interesting structures within network data. You'll learn about essential concepts such as cliques, communities, and subgraphs, which will leverage all of the skills you acquired in Chapter 2. By the end of this chapter, you'll be ready to apply the concepts you've learned to a real-world case study.}
